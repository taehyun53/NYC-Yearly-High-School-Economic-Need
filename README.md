Economic Need Index is the measure of the socioeconomic circumstances of a school’s population and the score is assigned to each school on the number of students eligible for free lunch or public assistance or who live in temporary housing. Through the Demographic Snapshot District data, I extracted the features of the borough that has low economic need index scores to make a comparison with the borough with the highest economic need index and performed statistical tests and created visualization charts. In addition, I extracted insights from each borough and created a predictive model that can predict the economic need index.
